## CloudFormation

Started off CloudFormation with a guest instructor __Rohini Gaonkar, an AWS Sr. Dev__ Advocate leading instruction along with Andrew. We walked through setting up a basic CloudFormation template deploying an ECS Cluster. We also created a deploy script that deployed the cluster, along with a new S3 bucket named cfn-artifacts-1. In addition to this, we add a task to our .gitpod.yml file to install cfn-lint. Per ChatGPT, "cfn-lint is a tool used for linting CloudFormation templates, which checks for syntactical errors, best practices, and adherence to standards. It ensures the correctness and quality of the CloudFormation template."

# Networking Layer

Moving onto main instruction, we now have a cfn folder created in aws directory. We create a new folder within this directory named networking. Next we create a new file in this folder named template.yaml. We begin, just fleshing out the template.yaml, commenting what we're going to need.

```
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09

# VPC
# IGW
# Route Tables
# Subnets
# Subnet A
# Subnet B
# Subnet C
```


We immediately consult AWS documentation for the VPC, which in CloudFormation is known as AWS::EC2::VPC.

```
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09

# VPC
Resources:
  VPC:
    Type: AWS::EC2::VPC
    Properties:
      CidrBlock:

      EnableDnsSupport: true
      InstanceTenancy: default
# IGW
# Route Tables
# Subnets
# Subnet A
# Subnet B
# Subnet C
```
  
In our ./bin/cfn directory, we create a new script named networking-deploy.

```
#! /usr/bin/env bash
set -e #stop the execution of the script if it fails

CFN_PATH="/workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/aws/cfn/networking/template.yaml"

cfn-lint $CFN_PATH 

aws cloudformation deploy \
    --stack-name "Cruddur" \
    --s3-bucket $CFN_BUCKET \
    --template-file $CFN_PATH \
    --no-execute-changeset \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM

```
  
We set the value for a variable named CFN_PATH to the path for our template.yaml file for our network layer.

Next, we deploy a CloudFormation stack using the aws cloudformation deploy command. Here are the options and arguments used:

--stack-name: Specifies the name of the stack to create or update. In this case, it's set to "Cruddur".

--s3-bucket: Specifies the S3 bucket to upload the CloudFormation template to. The value of the CFN_BUCKET variable is expected to be set somewhere else in the script or in the environment.

--template-file: Specifies the path to the CloudFormation template file, which is set to the value of the CFN_PATH variable.

--no-execute-changeset: Indicates that the changeset created during the deployment should not be executed immediately. It allows you to review the changes before applying them.

--capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM: Specifies the IAM capabilities required to create or update IAM resources in the CloudFormation stack. This capability is necessary when the template includes IAM resources.

```
export CFN_BUCKET="cfn-artifacts-1"
gp env CFN_BUCKET="cfn-artifacts-1"
```

We have yet to fill in a value for the CidrBlock property in our networking template.yaml file.  https://cidr.xyz to determine what we'll use for our CIDR block for our VPC. this will determine the range of IP addresses that can be assigned to the resources within our VPC and also help us maintain higher availability of our resources.

When the VPC completes, we found that AWS also automatically creates a route table for you. In sifting through the resources, we had a bit of trouble with our previous configuration resources showing in the console. To remedy this, we decide to name the VPC resource as well, so we add tags to our template.yaml.

```
 Tags:
        - Key: Name
          Value: CruddurVPC
```

This will name our VPC resource as CruddurVPC. The next resource we must create is an internet gateway. We go back to AWS documentation and look specifically for AWS::EC2::InternetGateway. There's no properties to set for an internet gateway other than tags, so we implement the code:

```
  IGW:
    # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ec2-internetgateway.html
    Type: AWS::EC2::InternetGateway
    Properties: 
      Tags:
        - Key: Name
          Value: CruddurIGW
```


When we create an internet gateway, we also must tell our CFN template to attach it. We consult AWS documentation for AWS::EC2::VPCGatewayAttachment then begin specifying properties.

```
  AttachIGW:
    Type: AWS::EC2::VPCGatewayAttachment
    Properties:
      VpcId: !Ref VPC
      InternetGatewayId: !Ref IGW
```
  
You’ll note the !Ref function being used here. !Ref VPC and !Ref IGW are used for the VpcId and InternetGatewayId properties respectively to reference the VPC and IGW resources defined earlier in the template.

![ref](https://github.com/bhanumalhotra123/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/assets/144083659/e30194f5-9249-4832-898d-11c66f3caec1)
  
Implementing a route table, which is responsible for directing network traffic for our VPC.

```
  RouteTable:
    # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ec2-routetable.html
    Type: AWS::EC2::RouteTable
    Properties:
      VpcId: !Ref VPC 
      Tags:
        - Key: Name
          Value: CruddurRT
```

Next, we implement a route:

```
  RouteToIGW:
    # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ec2-route.html
    Type: AWS::EC2::Route
    DependsOn: AttachIGW
    Properties:
      RouteTableId: !Ref RouteTable
      GatewayId: !Ref IGW
      DestinationCidrBlock: 0.0.0.0/0
```

Please bring your attention to the DependsOn property. This property indicates that RouteToIGW will not be created if AttachIGW does not exist. So if our gateway is not created, CloudFormation will not create our route either. The GatewayId property is returning the logical id of the internet gateway we'd like to use, so we point it towards our IGW gateway. We want our route going out to the internet, so we set the DestinationCidrBlock to 0.0.0.0/0. The reasoning is, 0.0.0.0/0 represents the entire IPv4 address space in CIDR notation.


We also implement a route for local as well, but we’re uncertain on the GatewayId:

```
  RouteToLocal:
    # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ec2-route.html
    Type: AWS::EC2::Route
    DependsOn: AttachIGW
    Properties:
      RouteTableId: !Ref RouteTable
      GatewayId: "local"
      DestinationCidrBlock: 10.0.0.0/16
```

![image](https://github.com/bhanumalhotra123/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/assets/144083659/10759a5a-0f25-4641-8049-2d96862aca35)

Error received: "The route identified by 10.0.0.0/16 already exists."
Action taken: Commented out route creation code, deleted CloudFormation stack in ROLLBACK_COMPLETE state, redeployed with VPC, internet gateway, and gateway attachment only.
Observation: Network ACL created automatically. NACLs act as stateless firewalls for subnet-level traffic control.
Tip: Ensure NACLs have outbound routes to avoid blocking internet access.


We uncomment the lines of code creating our route table and our RouteToIGW. Then, we again deploy our networking CFN template. When the changeset is created, we execute it from CFN. When we go back to EC2 to view our our new route table, it automatically created the route to local as well:

![image](https://github.com/bhanumalhotra123/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/assets/144083659/5d64a896-4151-45c0-b9c3-13ee659418c0)


Since the route to local is already being created, we remove the commented lines of code creating that route. Next, we must create our subnets. We might decide that our database must sit privately, so in addition to our public subnets, we create private ones as well.

```

      AvailabilityZone: us-east-1c
      CidrBlock: 10.0.20.0/24
      EnableDns64: false
      MapPublicIpOnLaunch: false # private subnet
      VpcId: !Ref VPC
      Tags:
        - Key: Name
          Value: CruddurSubnetPriv3 
```

A few key takeaways from these properties:

AssignIpv6AddressOnCreation: controls whether IPV6 addresses are automatically assigned to instances that are launched in the subnet

AvailabilityZone: the availability zone within AWS that our subnet is created in

EnableDns64: controls whether DNS64 is enabled for an IPv6 enabled subnet. Since we're not using IPv6, this value is false

MapPublicIpOnLaunch: controls the automatic assignment of a public IP address to instances launched within a subnet. Notice our public subnets have this set to true, where our private ones are set to false.

Next we must implement our SubnetRouteTableAssocation resources. This will associate our subnets with our route table in the VPC.

```
SubnetPub1RTAssociation:
    # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ec2-subnetroutetableassociation.html
    Type: AWS::EC2::SubnetRouteTableAssociation

```

With this completed, we now try to deploy our template.yaml for our networking layer again. This time, cfn-lint gives us some feedback.

![image](https://github.com/bhanumalhotra123/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/assets/144083659/9238db89-30a9-46c6-bb2e-b9c7d38a3a8d)

To circumvent these warnings, we go ahead and pass some parameters in our networking template.
```
Parameters:
  Az1:
    Type: AWS::EC2::AvailabilityZone::Name
    Default: us-east-1a
  Az2:
    Type: AWS::EC2::AvailabilityZone::Name
    Default: us-east-1b
  Az3:
    Type: AWS::EC2::AvailabilityZone::Name
    Default: us-east-1c
```

Then we use the !Ref function to pass the values in our template, per subnet. For example:

```
AvailabilityZone: !Ref Az1
```

We again deploy the CFN template, this time the changeset is created. We execute it via AWS. The create fails this time, stating the IPv6CidrBlock cannot be empty. We review AWS documentation to see why.

![image](https://github.com/bhanumalhotra123/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/assets/144083659/b2e8ddf7-8cf9-4c21-895c-219b718012a7)


Per the snippet above, since we specified AssignIpv6AddressOnCreation, we must also specify Ipv6CidrBlock. Since neither is being used, we just remove the AssignIpv6AddressOnCreation property from our template. With the template file updated, we again run our networking-deploy script. We execute the changeset from CloudFormation and we have an UPDATE_COMPLETE status.

![Screenshot 2024-03-04 150018](https://github.com/bhanumalhotra123/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/assets/144083659/4980f762-3559-4c19-87e1-b37c9cdaa5a0)


we’re not going to implement security groups at this layer, because security groups are usually around particular services. We also decide we want to clean things up in our code a little bit, particularly our CidrBlock properties. We do this by implementing some parameters:

```
Parameters:
  SubnetCidrBlocks: 
    Description: "Comma-delimited list of CIDR blocks for our private public subnets"
    Type: CommaDelimitedList
    Default: > 
      10.0.0.0/24, 
      10.0.4.0/24, 
      10.0.8.0/24, 
      10.0.12.0/24, 
      10.0.16.0/24, 
      10.0.20.0/24   
```


You’ll note that we’re using a Comma Delimited List for our SubnetCidrBlocks parameter. Andrew explains how we're implementing this by using what's known as a scalar variable in Yaml.
A scalar is a variable that holds one value at a time. Scalars are generally primitive data types e.g. String, Int, Bool". We're using what's known as a folded block scalar style, using the folded start with a >. This allows CloudFormation to treat our parameter as a single string.
  
We’re able to reference these values for our CidrBlock property by using the !Select function.
```
CidrBlock: !Select [0, !Ref SubnetCidrBlocks]
```


In the above code snippet, we’re selecting the first element from the list of subnet CIDR blocks, i.e. 10.0.0.0/24.

We also add a parameter for our VPC CidrBlock property as well.
```
Parameters:
  VpcCidrBlock:
    Type: String
    Default: 10.0.0.0/16
```

We then pass the value of the parameter to the property using the !Ref function.

```
Resources: 
  VPC:
    # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ec2-vpc.html
    Type: AWS::EC2::VPC
    Properties:
      CidrBlock: !Ref VpcCidrBlock
```

From there, we update the tags for all of our resources that have them in our template.yaml to utilize pseudo parameters from AWS, in this instance, the AWS::StackName parameter for our VPC. 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/pseudo-parameter-reference.html

```
 Tags:
        - Key: Name
          Value: !Sub "${AWS::StackName}VPC"
```

Adding outputs will allow us to expose information about our resources created by the stack. We'll be able to use these outputs for other stacks when we implement future layers.


```
Outputs:
  VpcId:
    Value: !Ref VPC
    Export:
      Name: VpcId
  VpcCidrBlock:
    Value: !GetAtt VPC.CidrBlock
    Export:
      Name: VpcCidrBlock
  SubnetCidrBlocks:
    Value: !Join [",", !Ref SubnetCidrBlocks]
    Export:
      Name: SubnetCidrBlocks
  SubnetIds: 
    Value: !Join 
      - "," 
      - - !Ref SubnetPub1 
        - !Ref SubnetPub2 
        - !Ref SubnetPub3 
        - !Ref SubnetPriv1
        - !Ref SubnetPriv2
        - !Ref SubnetPriv3
    Export: 
      Name: SubnetIds
  AvailabilityZones:
    Value: !Join 
      - "," 
      - - !Ref Az1
        - !Ref Az2
        - !Ref Az3  
    Export: 
      Name: AvailabilityZones
```

Let’s breakdown each output:

VpcId: This output references the VPC resource using !Ref VPC. It exports the value with the name VpcId. This output can be referenced in other stacks to retrieve the VPC ID.

VpcCidrBlock: This output uses the !GetAtt function to retrieve the CidrBlock attribute of the VPC resource. It exports the value with the name VpcCidrBlock. This output provides the CIDR block of the VPC.

SubnetCidrBlocks: This output uses the !Join function to concatenate the values of SubnetCidrBlocks, which are referenced by !Ref SubnetCidrBlocks, separated by commas. It exports the joined value with the name SubnetCidrBlocks. This output provides a comma-separated list of subnet CIDR blocks.

SubnetIds: This output uses the !Join function to concatenate the values of SubnetPub1, SubnetPub2, SubnetPub3, SubnetPriv1, SubnetPriv2, and SubnetPriv3 separated by commas. The subnet values are obtained using !Ref for each subnet. It exports the joined value with the name SubnetIds. This output provides a comma-separated list of subnet IDs.

SubnetIds: This output uses the !Join function to concatenate the values of SubnetPub1, SubnetPub2, SubnetPub3, SubnetPriv1, SubnetPriv2, and SubnetPriv3 separated by commas. The subnet values are obtained using !Ref for each subnet. It exports the joined value with the name SubnetIds. This output provides a comma-separated list of subnet IDs.

AvailabilityZones: This output uses the !Join function to concatenate the values of Az1, Az2, and Az3 separated by commas. The availability zone values are obtained using !Ref for each availability zone. It exports the joined value with the name AvailabilityZones. This output provides a comma-separated list of availability zones.

When we again deploy then execute the changeset from CloudFormation, we now have Outputs available under the Outputs tab.
