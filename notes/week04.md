https://www.postgresql.org/

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 35 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance. RDS is a collection of managed services that makes it simple to set up, operate, and scale databases in the cloud. Database engines available for use with RDS include Aurora (MySQL or PostGreSQL compatible), MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.

- Created the RDS Postgres instance from the AWS CLI in Gitpod

```
aws rds create-db-instance \
  --db-instance-identifier cruddur-db-instance \
  --db-instance-class db.t3.micro \
  --engine postgres \
  --engine-version  14.6 \
  --master-username root \
  --master-user-password huEE33z2Qvl383 \
  --allocated-storage 20 \
  --availability-zone ca-central-1a \
  --backup-retention-period 0 \
  --port 5432 \
  --no-multi-az \
  --db-name cruddur \
  --storage-type gp2 \
  --publicly-accessible \
  --storage-encrypted \
  --enable-performance-insights \
  --performance-insights-retention-period 7 \
  --no-deletion-protection
```

 to connect to Postgres locally, use this command:

psql -Upostgres --host localhost
After entering our credentials to access the account

  
PSQL commands.
  
```
\x on -- expanded display when looking at data
\q -- Quit PSQL
\l -- List all databases
\c database_name -- Connect to a specific database
\dt -- List all tables in the current database
\d table_name -- Describe a specific table
\du -- List all users and their roles
\dn -- List all schemas in the current database
CREATE DATABASE database_name; -- Create a new database
DROP DATABASE database_name; -- Delete a database
CREATE TABLE table_name (column1 datatype1, column2 datatype2, ...); -- Create a new table
DROP TABLE table_name; -- Delete a table
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition; -- Select data from a table
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...); -- Insert data into a table
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ... WHERE condition; -- Update data in a table
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition; -- Delete data from a table
Once we were logged into the local database, we created a database named “cruddur”.
```


Created a database named “cruddur”.
```
CREATE database cruddur;
```
  
Setup tables for the database. 
In other languages like Ruby on Rails, they have a schema that defines the entire database.
Since Flask doesn’t have it, we are going to write the entire thing by hand instead.
To begin this, we created a new folder in ‘backend-flask’ named ‘db’ then created a new SQL file named schema.sql inside of that. 
As part of schema.sql, we need to have Postgres generate UUIDs. These are universally unique identifiers. 
It’s a randomly generated string of numbers generated by Postgres. To implement this, we needed to add an extension for it.

```
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
```
