Content for the coming 2 weeks(week 6 and week 7) being so closely related, we would combine them so as to give my fellow bootcampers and myself plenty of time to implement everything and get completely caught up.


We can't use psql command here which we used to connect to the db as we haven't installed it and it isn't worth setting it up.
So we are just testing the connection instead.
Created a new script file in ‘/backend-flask/db/’ named test.

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import psycopg
import os
import sys

connection_url = os.getenv("CONNECTION_URL")

conn = None
try:
  print('attempting connection')
  conn = psycopg.connect(connection_url)
  print("Connection successful!")
except psycopg.Error as e:
  print("Unable to connect to the database:", e)
finally:
  conn.close()
```

We need to implement a health check endpoint into our app as well. We begin in the backend. In our ‘app.py’ file, we add a health check.


### The reason of not using tools like curl in this:
Shell Injection: If your application dynamically constructs curl commands using user input or other untrusted data, it could be vulnerable to shell injection attacks, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands within the container.
  
```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import urllib.request

try:
  response = urllib.request.urlopen('http://localhost:4567/api/health-check')
  if response.getcode() == 200:
    print("[OK] Flask server is running")
    exit(0) # success
  else:
    print("[BAD] Flask server is not running")
    exit(1) # false
# This for some reason is not capturing the error....
#except ConnectionRefusedError as e:
# so we'll just catch on all even though this is a bad practice
except Exception as e:
  print(e)
  exit(1) # false
```

### we will also need a new AWS Cloudwatch group.
> We login to the AWS Console, then go to Cloudwatch, and view Logs > Log groups. Then back in our codespace, > from the CLI, we create the log group.

Created our ECS cluster. Did it through the CLI instead of the console because AWS changes their UI so frequently, there’s no point in getting familiar with one layout.

```
aws ecs create-cluster \
--cluster-name cruddur \
--service-connect-defaults namespace=cruddur
```
